CAPTIONS FOR IMAGES:

1. This shows the list of items (employees in this case) as well as view of the rest of the UI.
	11. I forgot to take this screenshot immediately so it's a bit out of order, but it fits here: This is me filtering by ID descending
	12. And sorting by name
	13. And sorting by name descending. Other sorts are there too, the framework I used implemented them by default.

2. Showing a filter by name. Partial matches don't work, has to be the full thing.
3. Filtering by ID. Numbers + letters will result in a blank page (Unless a name has numbers).
4. Clicking the new employee button brings up this window.
5. Filling in the contents. This program won't automatically refresh when updates are made to the editor; the refresh button is implemented for that.
6. Clicked refresh. It also removes the editor from being visible.
7. Clicking on an item that already exists will bring up the editor, with the values filled in.
8. Joe has been deleted.
9. Clicking on Steve, and updating his name to Stevey.
10. He's Stevey now.
